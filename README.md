6119OOP-FinalProject-SocialEngine
=================================


SocialEngine is an application that was developed as a final project for CPSC 6119 - Object Oriented Development. SocialEngine demonstrates a virtual environment where people respond to perceived events that occur randomly in the environment. The type of events include, Light, Sound, and Scary. Each person will react differently depending on their behavioral attributes and ability to detect the event.


This was a team effort by a coworker, Chris McCleary, who was in the same class. We named the project "SocialEngine", though it should not be confused with "Social" in the sense of "Social Media". It is "Social" in the sense of demonstrating a physical social environment. It was our original intent to start from this code base and build up to something we could use to build online game environments with smart, evolving NPCs.  This project is just a very basic beginning to that and should not, by any means, be considered a complete solution. It does, however, act as a pretty good proof of concept to build upon.
